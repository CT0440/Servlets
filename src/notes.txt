JDK : https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886
Click on JDK21 - Stable version- Windows - x64 MSI Installer
click on and download https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21_windows-x64_bin.msi (sha256)

Step 1: Open Environment Variables
Press Windows + S and search for
Edit the system environment variables
Click to open System Properties.
In the System Properties window, click the button:
Environment Variables...

Step 2: Add JDK bin Directory to Path
Under System Variables, scroll and find the variable named Path.
Click on Path, then click Edit.
In the edit window, click New and paste the full path to your JDK bin folder. Example:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin
Click OK on all windows to save and close.

Step 3: Verify Installation
Open Command Prompt (cmd)
Type the following commands one by one:
java -version
javac -version
You should see output like:
java version "21.0.x"
javac 21.0.x

What is Web?
------------
* The web(short for World wide web) is a System where people can Access information(like websites, videos, articles) over the internet.
* You can use like chrome, safari or Firefox to open webpages.

Term - A collection of related web pages.
Example:www.google.com

Webpage:
A single page on a website.
Example: Google's Homepage

Browser: A Software to view websites.
Example: Chrome

Server: A computer that Stores Websites and sends them to your browser when you request.

Client: Your computer or mobile that requests and views the website.


How the Web Works?
------------------
1. You type a URL in the Browser.
2. The Browser Send a Request to the Website's Server.
3. The server responds with the Webpage.
4. The Browser Displays the Page for you.




frontend -> Backend -> Database


What is Servlet?
----------------
Java Servlet is a Java Program that runs on a Java enabled Web Server or Application Server.
It handles Client Requests, processes them, and generates responses Dynamically.
Servlets are the Backbone of many server-side Java Applications due to their Efficiency and Scalability.

Key-Features
------------
> Servlets work on the server side.
> servlets are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the web server.
> Generate Dynamic responses Efficiently.

Java Servlet Architecture

How Servlet Works?

			 |__________________|

				Server

> When Client sends Request the Client will Expect some page.
That page is Either static or Dynamic Page.
static page  means that is already Build. so already have a file that file sends to the client.
Dynamic page means Build at Runtime. So there is no static file with that link.
so server send the request to the helper Application (web container).

In that web container servlets will be there. servlet is a java program that process the information from the client give the response in the form of html page  to the client.

Examples of web containers: Apache Tomcat, Glass Fish, WebSphere etc these are called as feature of AppServer as as Webserver.

Example:
for Example I am sending abc.html client request to the server , 
server does not have the filename so it goes to server.
here by using of web.xml file called as deployment descriptor tells the server which servlet is called for the which request.
so in web.xml file it is having collection of servlet classes that tells the for which servlet process which file is called at that time.
and process the particular servlet and give response back to the client in a html page in the form of response object.


Servlet API
-----------
Servlet API is a set of Interfaces, classes and methods Provided by Java EE that helps:
> Build Server-side Applications
>Handle Http Requests and Responses
> manage Web Server and Client Communication

The Servlet API is mainly inside 2 Important packages:
* javax.servlet.*;
* javax.servlet.http.*;

Servlet API Life Cycle
----------------------
step	method			purpose
1	init()			Called once when servlet is created
2	service()		Called Every time when Request comes
3	destroy()		Called once when servlet is being removed

Simple Structure
-----------------
Client Browser
     ↓ (Request)
Servlet Container (Tomcat/Jetty)
     ↓ (Servlet API used internally)
Your Servlet (extends HttpServlet)
     ↓ (Response)
Client Browser


Execution of Java Servlets
-------------------------
Steps:
1. Client send Request to the Web Server
2. Web Server receives the Request
3. The Webserver passes the Request to the Corresponding servlet
4. The Servlet processes the request and generates the response in the form of output.
5. the Servlet sends the response back to the web server.
6. The web server send the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.

Installation of Tomcat
----------------------
>tomcat download
> select the version (10.1) 
> go to eclipse >window > show view > servers -> no servers will be there
>select tomcat version you installed and link that one.
> it will show on the servers. 

note: run the tomacat server defaultlt he tomcat server runs at 8080 port number.
check on browser localhost:8080 the tomcat server is starts it will show page not found error.

creating first project using servlet concept:
-----------------------------------------------
1. select the server.
2. create dynamic web project and select server and path.
3.In that create index.html file.
